# Snake Game With a Twist!

(Project for UTSC CSCB58)

A simple game of snake using FPGA board, Verilog and VGA monitor.
Using KEY3 to KEY0 to control the snake, players strive to eat the white blob (apple) to earn points, while increasing in length, and not going out of bounds. Players can eat any of the 4 powerups, where red is the most dangerous one, which eats up your points (those under 100). Eating green reduces your length to 1. Eating dark blue increases your speed to 2, and light blue slows you down to 1.

With a visible score board and high score, players can compete in turns to see who gets the highest score!
